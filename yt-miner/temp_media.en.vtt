00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.919
I've always been jealous of Winston Churchill.

00:00:02.961 --> 00:00:04.546
There's a quote, by the way.

00:00:04.546 --> 00:00:08.091
The history of innovation
is the bed, the bus and the bathtub.

00:00:08.216 --> 00:00:11.553
It's always these moments
when we're not really thinking about work

00:00:11.678 --> 00:00:15.098
or we're kind of doing something else
that good ideas come to us.

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.974
Winston Churchill,

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:20.270
He's sitting in the bathtub,
and he's dictating a national address

00:00:20.353 --> 00:00:22.105
to his assistant who's in the other room.

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.358
She's saying, "distinguished ladies and gentlemen"

00:00:25.358 --> 00:00:27.277
"Don't call them distinguished"

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:28.319
"They're not"

00:00:28.361 --> 00:00:31.114
This is the Gary Oldman version.
"They're not distinguished."

00:00:31.239 --> 00:00:35.118
You know, "Dear ladies and gentlemen, we have gathered together."

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.453
"Get to the point!"

00:00:37.662 --> 00:00:39.664
and I'm watching this going

00:00:39.706 --> 00:00:45.754
I would give anything to have an assistant
who understood my context and my voice and

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:50.467
my intent well enough that I could sit in
the bath and they could write my speech.

00:00:50.592 --> 00:00:54.512
Now, the poorest villager in Palo Alto

00:00:54.512 --> 00:00:57.057
can have what only Winston Churchill

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:57.891
used to have,

00:00:58.016 --> 00:01:04.314
which is an assistant that has my context
and my voice and my intent available to me

00:01:04.355 --> 00:01:08.485
so that when I'm in the bathtub,
I can be dictating my address.

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.906
That is absolutely
technically possible today.

00:01:12.906 --> 00:01:15.617
Exploring Human Agency in the age of AI

00:01:15.617 --> 00:01:18.536
Exploring Human Agency in the age of AI : Uncoded

00:01:18.536 --> 00:01:20.705
Ep.1 How to Become a Better Collaborator with AI

00:01:20.705 --> 00:01:24.626
I'm Jeremy Utley,
I'm an adjunct professor of creativity

00:01:24.709 --> 00:01:26.753
and AI at Stanford University.

00:01:26.878 --> 00:01:29.506
I've been teaching at Stanford
for the last 15 years

00:01:29.631 --> 00:01:33.301
at the intersection of creativity,
innovation, entrepreneurship, and now

00:01:33.343 --> 00:01:35.762
increasingly, artificial intelligence.

00:01:35.804 --> 00:01:41.059
The topic that I'm most focused on right
now is helping non-technical professionals

00:01:41.184 --> 00:01:46.314
learn to be good collaborators to or with generative AI. 

00:01:46.314 --> 00:01:47.649
And then two years ago,

00:01:47.774 --> 00:01:51.653
myself and my partner at the time,
Perry Klebahn, wrote a book called

00:01:51.736 --> 00:01:56.783
Idea Flow, which was the canonical book
on idea generation and prototyping.

00:01:56.908 --> 00:01:58.034
So super proud of that.

00:01:58.076 --> 00:02:02.080
It was the culmination of a dozen years
of leading executive programs

00:02:02.205 --> 00:02:06.209
and the leadership program and the
entrepreneurship program at Stanford.

00:02:06.251 --> 00:02:11.548
And one month after our book came out,
ChatGPT came out.

00:02:11.548 --> 00:02:18.096
To me, the fact that I wrote the canonical book
on Idea generation just prior to AI

00:02:18.221 --> 00:02:23.226
is like writing the best book on retail
just before the internet.

00:02:23.268 --> 00:02:27.981
AI is a tool to dramatically augment
and amplify our creativity.

00:02:28.106 --> 00:02:31.401
And the truth is, I didn't know
a lot about it when the book came out.

00:02:31.484 --> 00:02:36.489
So one month after my book came out,
instead of going on a world book tour,

00:02:36.573 --> 00:02:41.244
I strapped myself back into the front row
as a student and said,

00:02:41.286 --> 00:02:44.163
I need to be learning about
this transformative new technology.

00:02:44.289 --> 00:02:47.417
So I started taking classes.
I started conducting research.

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:52.797
I started working with and studying teams
inside of organizations, using the tool

00:02:52.881 --> 00:02:55.091
to understand the simple question,

00:02:55.133 --> 00:03:00.597
how does generative AI impact
the individual and the team and the

00:03:00.722 --> 00:03:04.726
organization's ability to solve problems?

00:03:04.726 --> 00:03:06.811
Chapter1. Don't Ask AI, Let It Ask You

00:03:06.811 --> 00:03:09.814
You can give an AI a prompt, for example.

00:03:09.898 --> 00:03:12.525
How should I answer this question?

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:15.528
Or you could give an AI
the question

00:03:15.528 --> 00:03:18.448
I want to ask how I should answer this question.

00:03:18.448 --> 00:03:22.744
What's the best way of framing
that question to an AI?

00:03:22.869 --> 00:03:24.287
So you see what I did there?

00:03:24.287 --> 00:03:27.999
I asked AI for how to ask I my question,

00:03:28.041 --> 00:03:33.838
but you can use AI to use AI, which is
you couldn't use Excel to use Excel.

00:03:33.922 --> 00:03:35.840
PowerPoint can't teach you how to use PowerPoint.

00:03:35.924 --> 00:03:37.759
Email can't teach you how to use email.

00:03:37.884 --> 00:03:41.763
AI strangely can teach you
how to use itself if you think to ask.

00:03:41.888 --> 00:03:45.475
Go to your language model of choice
and just say the following.

00:03:45.558 --> 00:03:48.061
Hey, you're an AI expert.

00:03:48.144 --> 00:03:53.483
I would love your help and a consultation
with you to help me figure out

00:03:53.566 --> 00:03:56.778
where I can best leverage AI in my life.

00:03:56.903 --> 00:04:01.074
As an AI expert, would you please ask
me questions one question at a time,

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:05.620
until you have enough context about my
workflows and responsibilities and KPIs

00:04:05.662 --> 00:04:07.664
and and objectives that you could

00:04:07.789 --> 00:04:12.502
make two obvious recommendations
and two non-obvious recommendations

00:04:12.585 --> 00:04:15.254
for how AI could leverage AI in my work.

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:20.218
you will have one of the most enlightening
and illuminating conversations you've ever had,

00:04:20.218 --> 00:04:24.472
and it's all because of AI's ability to evaluate its own work. 

00:04:24.555 --> 00:04:28.685
What I've seen is non-technical employees
are able to do incredible things.

00:04:28.768 --> 00:04:29.811
Here's one example.

00:04:29.894 --> 00:04:32.981
The National Park Service called me
and asked me if I would

00:04:33.064 --> 00:04:37.110
conduct a training program
for a bunch of backcountry rangers,

00:04:37.193 --> 00:04:42.115
so they gathered a group of about 60
backcountry rangers and facilities managers

00:04:42.115 --> 00:04:43.408
into a training session,

00:04:43.533 --> 00:04:49.414
and I spent a couple of hours over zoom
teaching folks the basics of collaborating with AI.

00:04:49.414 --> 00:04:53.543
One of the people in that
session was a gentleman named Adam Rymer,

00:04:53.584 --> 00:04:55.878
who works at Glen Canyon National Park.

00:04:55.962 --> 00:05:00.758
And one of the things I say is you
should focus on parts of your work that you dread.

00:05:00.758 --> 00:05:03.678
Parts of your work that you don't enjoy.

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:05.138
"Ah, I have to do this again."

00:05:05.263 --> 00:05:09.017
And Adam said, if I have to replace
the carpet tiles in the lodge.

00:05:09.142 --> 00:05:10.893
I have to fill out all this paperwork.

00:05:10.977 --> 00:05:15.440
And so to replace a carpet tile will
sometimes take 2 or 3 days of paperwork.

00:05:15.523 --> 00:05:18.651
Then he thought,
could AI help me write that paperwork?

00:05:18.735 --> 00:05:23.740
And in 45 minutes,
he built a tool with natural language

00:05:23.823 --> 00:05:26.409
that saves him two days of work.

00:05:26.451 --> 00:05:30.413
Every day he makes a statement of work
and then listen to this.

00:05:30.455 --> 00:05:35.626
Someone got access to that tool
and shared it across the other parks.

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:38.004
There's about 430 parks in the service.

00:05:38.046 --> 00:05:42.258
The National Park Service is estimating
that the tool that Adam built in 45 minutes

00:05:42.341 --> 00:05:47.847
is going to save the service 7000 days of human labor this year.

00:05:48.139 --> 00:05:55.146
That's the kind of impact that normal
professionals can have, even without

00:05:55.146 --> 00:06:02.028
any technical ability, if only they're given
very basic foundational training.

00:06:02.028 --> 00:06:04.697
Chapter2. Do not Use AI, Treat It as a Teammate

00:06:04.697 --> 00:06:08.493
People are wanting to learn AI and how it
can be transformative for their business,

00:06:08.576 --> 00:06:11.287
but they don't have the basic language.

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:15.375
And so while lots of organizations
are asking me how can we work with AI

00:06:15.458 --> 00:06:16.793
to transform our business?

00:06:16.876 --> 00:06:20.213
Where I have to start with them is
how do you work with AI?

00:06:20.296 --> 00:06:23.633
The research I'm familiar with suggests
that while on the one hand,

00:06:23.716 --> 00:06:29.305
AI makes people 25% faster
and 12% more work and 40% better quality,

00:06:29.389 --> 00:06:33.726
it's also true that less than 10%
of working professionals

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:37.688
are deriving meaningful productivity gains
from collaboration with AI.

00:06:37.772 --> 00:06:42.026
To me, there's this enormous gap.
I call it the realization gap.

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:45.696
We conducted studies both
in Europe and in the United States.

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:51.285
And what we found is, surprisingly, AI
didn't help most people be more creative.

00:06:51.369 --> 00:06:56.541
In fact, in many cases, the people that we
studied, AI made them less creative.

00:06:56.624 --> 00:06:58.126
And as we started digging
into the research,

00:06:58.209 --> 00:07:00.711
we were surprised and looked at the data.

00:07:00.795 --> 00:07:03.965
We were confused because you
think AI should make people

00:07:04.048 --> 00:07:05.425
more creative, not less.

00:07:05.508 --> 00:07:10.596
And we studied the underperformers
and then we studied the Outperformers.

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:15.893
And what we found is the Outperformers
had a fundamentally different orientation

00:07:15.977 --> 00:07:21.774
towards AI than the underperformers did,
whereas the underperformers

00:07:21.858 --> 00:07:23.734
treated AI like a tool.

00:07:23.818 --> 00:07:28.281
The outperformers
treated AI like a teammate,

00:07:28.364 --> 00:07:33.077
and shifting your orientation
from tool to teammate changes everything

00:07:33.161 --> 00:07:36.205
about the kinds of outcomes that you can achieve

00:07:36.205 --> 00:07:40.126
working with generative AI.
A simple example is what do you do

00:07:40.209 --> 00:07:43.254
when it gives you mediocre results?

00:07:43.337 --> 00:07:48.342
If it's a tool, you get a mediocre result
and then maybe you improve it.

00:07:48.426 --> 00:07:51.262
Or maybe you say,
it's no good at doing that.

00:07:51.345 --> 00:07:54.015
If it's a teammate
who's giving you a mediocre result,

00:07:54.098 --> 00:07:58.186
think about the last teammate who gave you
work product that wasn't sufficient.

00:07:58.269 --> 00:07:59.645
You gave them feedback.

00:07:59.729 --> 00:08:04.317
You gave them coaching, you gave them
mentorship, you helped them improve it.

00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:08.613
And so what we found is that people
who treat AI like a teammate, coach it

00:08:08.696 --> 00:08:13.326
and give it feedback and importantly,
get it to ask them questions.

00:08:13.409 --> 00:08:16.287
The fundamental orientation
a lot of people take towards AI

00:08:16.370 --> 00:08:18.456
is I'm the question asker.

00:08:18.497 --> 00:08:20.208
AI is the answer giver.

00:08:20.833 --> 00:08:25.254
But if you think about AI like a teammate,
you say, hey, what are ten questions

00:08:25.338 --> 00:08:26.547
I should ask about this?

00:08:26.631 --> 00:08:31.052
Or what do you need to know from me
in order to get the best response?

00:08:31.135 --> 00:08:34.639
So things, for example,
like you have a difficult conversation

00:08:34.722 --> 00:08:36.265
coming up with a coworker.

00:08:36.349 --> 00:08:38.893
Did you know you could leverage
a large language model

00:08:38.976 --> 00:08:41.229
to roleplay that conversation?

00:08:41.312 --> 00:08:45.483
You can get an AI to interview you
about your conversation partner,

00:08:45.566 --> 00:08:49.362
and then construct a psychological profile
of your conversation partner,

00:08:49.445 --> 00:08:53.199
and then play the role of your
conversation partner in a roleplay,

00:08:53.282 --> 00:08:57.161
and then give you feedback from the
perspective of your conversation partner

00:08:57.245 --> 00:08:59.580
on how you approach the conversation.

00:08:59.664 --> 00:09:03.834
That's something you can do today,
and there are many things like that.

00:09:03.918 --> 00:09:04.877
I call them drills,

00:09:04.961 --> 00:09:08.881
but there are many things like that
where if someone will just shift

00:09:08.965 --> 00:09:11.634
their consideration set of what

00:09:11.717 --> 00:09:16.389
are the things I can do with AI.
They end up discovering applications

00:09:16.472 --> 00:09:17.765
that I've never even dreamed of.

00:09:17.848 --> 00:09:21.143
I've been doing this stuff for two years,
and my students are regularly

00:09:21.227 --> 00:09:26.232
coming to me with use cases I've never
imagined that landed them in a destination

00:09:26.315 --> 00:09:27.483
I could have never predicted,

00:09:27.567 --> 00:09:30.111
and they could never have predicted.

00:09:30.528 --> 00:09:33.698
For me, I never thought about myself
as a creative individual.

00:09:33.781 --> 00:09:38.035
Now, I fully and fundamentally believe
every single human being

00:09:38.119 --> 00:09:40.413
has innate creative capacity.

00:09:40.496 --> 00:09:41.789
Every single one of us.

00:09:41.872 --> 00:09:45.710
What the D.school has helped me do
is unlock others.

00:09:45.793 --> 00:09:48.713
Everyone has
this latent creative capacity.

00:09:48.796 --> 00:09:52.133
Once I was teaching a class
with a hip hop artist named Lecrae.

00:09:52.216 --> 00:09:56.220
He's a multi-time Grammy Award winning
artist, and he and I are teaching a class

00:09:56.304 --> 00:09:59.390
to graduate students at Stanford,
and we're giving them the assignment.

00:09:59.473 --> 00:10:01.475
You've got to go get
inspiration in the world.

00:10:01.559 --> 00:10:05.104
And what I can see is it's like looking
at myself in the mirror ten years ago,

00:10:05.187 --> 00:10:06.897
because all
of the business school students

00:10:06.981 --> 00:10:10.151
in the class are going, "inspiration?"

00:10:10.234 --> 00:10:15.281
And I just felt Lecrae is clearly
the The creative legend in the room.

00:10:15.364 --> 00:10:18.534
I said, Lecrae,
what do you think about inspiration?

00:10:18.618 --> 00:10:21.495
And of course, as only a hip hop
artist could do, he dropped a bar.

00:10:21.579 --> 00:10:24.957
He said, inspiration is a discipline.

00:10:24.957 --> 00:10:27.877
And I realized in that moment,
for these students,

00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:33.758
it's not even on their radar as a tool,
let alone a routine part of their life.

00:10:33.841 --> 00:10:39.263
But the most wildly creative individuals
I know are disciplined about cultivating

00:10:39.347 --> 00:10:41.849
the inputs to their thinking,
because they know it affects

00:10:41.932 --> 00:10:43.434
the outputs of their thinking.

00:10:43.517 --> 00:10:47.146
And so, even in regards to AI,
I push people.

00:10:47.229 --> 00:10:49.815
What is the inspiration
you're bringing to the model?

00:10:49.899 --> 00:10:52.985
Everybody has the same access
to the same ChatGPT.

00:10:53.069 --> 00:10:55.279
How do I get a different output
than you do?

00:10:55.363 --> 00:10:59.075
It's because of what I bring to the model.
And what do I bring to the model?

00:10:59.158 --> 00:11:03.079
Certainly I bring technique,
but I also bring my experience.

00:11:03.162 --> 00:11:04.705
I bring my perspective.

00:11:04.789 --> 00:11:07.541
I bring all the inspiration
I've gleaned from the world.

00:11:07.625 --> 00:11:11.462
That's what gets a user
a differential output from a model.

00:11:11.462 --> 00:11:14.507
Chapter3. How to Go Beyond ‘Good Enough’ Ideas

00:11:14.507 --> 00:11:18.552
A seventh grader in Ohio
who I don't even know what her name is,

00:11:18.636 --> 00:11:20.221
but her teacher asked, what is creativity?

00:11:20.304 --> 00:11:22.598
And she put a post-it note up on the board that says,

00:11:22.598 --> 00:11:24.266
Creativity is doing more

00:11:24.266 --> 00:11:26.435
than the first thing you think of.

00:11:27.353 --> 00:11:31.607
And that's my favorite definition,
because it speaks to a profound

00:11:31.691 --> 00:11:33.901
cognitive bias that we hold.

00:11:33.984 --> 00:11:37.530
It's been called functional fixedness.
It's been called the Einstellung effect.

00:11:37.613 --> 00:11:44.245
But the basic premise is humans tend
to fixate on an early solution

00:11:44.328 --> 00:11:45.371
and be satisfied.

00:11:45.454 --> 00:11:48.999
Herbert Simon called it satisficing,
but it's the idea that if we get

00:11:49.083 --> 00:11:51.085
to good enough, it's enough.

00:11:51.168 --> 00:11:53.838
And that's why I love
that seventh graders definition.

00:11:53.921 --> 00:11:56.424
Creativity is doing more
than the first thing you think of.

00:11:56.507 --> 00:11:59.301
It's pushing past. Good enough.

00:11:59.385 --> 00:12:03.013
Is the definition of creativity
changing in the age of AI?

00:12:03.097 --> 00:12:04.598
I don't think so.

00:12:04.682 --> 00:12:10.396
The reality is, with AI, it's now easier
than ever to get good enough.

00:12:10.479 --> 00:12:13.983
If your goal is world class,
if your goal is exceptional, then what you

00:12:14.066 --> 00:12:20.072
want to be prompting for is actually
volume and variation, and that takes time.

00:12:20.156 --> 00:12:25.536
It takes time to not only read through it,
but to sort it and to process it.

00:12:25.619 --> 00:12:30.207
But fundamentally, the definition
of creativity doesn't change in the age of AI.

00:12:30.207 --> 00:12:35.713
It's just that the human's ability
or inability to arrive at a creative state

00:12:35.796 --> 00:12:38.466
is affected not only by the technology,

00:12:38.549 --> 00:12:45.514
but also by their stated or unstated
objectives in collaborating with it.

00:12:45.598 --> 00:12:49.310
Creators don't need to be afraid of AI.
Creators need to dive in.

00:12:49.393 --> 00:12:50.644
They need to lean in.

00:12:50.728 --> 00:12:55.566
Creators are about to be unleashed in
a way they've never been unleashed before.

00:12:55.649 --> 00:12:59.487
The only correct answer
to the question how do you use AI?

00:12:59.570 --> 00:13:04.450
Is I don't.
I don't use AI. I work with it.

00:13:04.533 --> 00:13:09.079
When you start working with AI,
it will change everything.
