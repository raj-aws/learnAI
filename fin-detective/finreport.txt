MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS → BUSINESS OVERVIEW
Industry Overview
India’s retail industry has evolved
into one of the most dynamic
and rapidly expanding sectors,
contributing immensely to the
development of our country.
According to a recent report by the
Boston Consulting Group and the
Retailers Association of India, India’s
retail sector is projected to reach
an impressive ` 190 lakh crore by
2034, growing at a compounded
annual growth rate (CAGR) of
9%. The share of organised retail
constitutes 18% of the total retail
market, while the unorganised
segment, characterised by
presence of millions of small
kiranas, constitutes the remaining
82%.
India remains one of the world’s
fastest-growing retail markets and
is poised to become the thirdlargest
retail market by 2030.
Strategic Objective
Transform the
retail landscape
through synergistic
partnerships creating
shared wins for all
stakeholders across
the retail value chain.
Guided by innovation
and relentless focus on
customer-centricity,
Reliance Retail will
continue to deliver
exceptional value
and a differentiated
experience to Indian
consumers across
key categories
and omnichannel
platforms—shaping
the future of retail
in India.

Key Financial Ratios
The net capital turnover ratio improved
from 25.43 in FY 2023-24 to 47.92 in
FY 2024-25, due to reduction in net
working capital.
The operating margin ratio declined to
7.2% in FY 2024-25 as against 9.8% in
previous year primarily due to weaker
transportation fuels and downstream
chemical margins.
The return on net worth* fell to 8.2% in
FY 2024-25 as against 10.3% in previous
year due to decline in O2C earnings.
*Adjusted for CWIP and revaluation
Liquidity and
Capital Resources
Macro Environment
FY 2024–25 witnessed high volatility
in financial markets. In India, first
half of the financial year saw global
outperformance of Indian assets
driven by healthy growth momentum,
continued improvement in fiscal
health, which led to prospect of rating
upgrade, and bond index inclusion flows.
Softening global yield environment
helped India benchmark 10y G-sec yield
to ease decisively below 7%, while rupee
remained stable.
However, second half of the financial
year saw large outflows from foreign
portfolio investors, softening of growth
momentum in India and resurgence of
China as an investment destination. This
had a depreciative effect on INR and
tightened banking system liquidity. As a
result, from December 2024 onwards,
RBI began easing financial conditions
through a mix of CRR cut, Repo rate cuts
and injection of rupee liquidity.
Fund Raising
Despite a volatile environment, RIL
successfully executed a multi-currency,
multi-instrument financing strategy,
achieving an optimal capital structure at
competitive costs. The proceeds were
primarily utilised to fund green capital
expenditures and to refinance upcoming
debt maturities.
Offshore Facilities
Syndicated Term Loan
Facilities (~$3 billion
equivalent)
The Company secured these facilities to
refinance maturing debt obligations.
ECA Supported Facilities
(~$1 billion equivalent)
RIL tied up ~$1 billion equivalent green
SACE Push facilities supported by Italian
Export Credit Agency (SACE) to finance
capital expenditure towards eligible
green projects. This is the first such fully
green-labelled facility for the Company.
Liquidity Management
RIL maintains a robust liquidity
management framework to ensure
financial flexibility and resilience in
all market conditions. The Company
leveraged a diverse funding strategy
and efficiently managed working capital.
RIL’s surplus funds were deployed in
stable yield instruments, insulated from
unfavourable market movements to
ensure immediate access to liquidity.
Credit Rating
RIL continues to be rated two notches above sovereign by S&P and one notch above
sovereign by Moody’s.
Instrument Rating Agency Ratings Remarks
International Debt S&P BBB+ Two notches above India’s sovereign rating
International Debt Moody’s Baa2 One notch above India’s sovereign rating
Long-Term Debt CRISIL AAA (Stable) Highest rating by CRISIL
Long-Term Debt CARE AAA (Stable) Highest rating by CARE
Long-Term Debt ICRA AAA (Stable) Highest rating by ICRA
Long-Term Debt India Ratings AAA (Stable) Highest rating by India Ratings
Way Forward
RIL remains committed to maintaining a strong liquidity
position and a robust capital structure to enable organic
growth and strategic investments. The Company
generates strong cash flows, enabling it to fund strategic
initiatives, service debt, and deliver long-term value
to shareholders. RIL will continue to prioritise prudent
capital allocation within a robust risk management
framework to achieve its strategic goals.

Industry Overview
Transportation Fuels

In FY 2024-25, the transportation fuel
sector faced demand growth challenges
on the back of geopolitics, energy
transition, efficiency improvement, and
economic concerns. Oil demand rose
by 0.9 mb/d to 103.1 mb/d, while supply
also increased by 1.1 mb/d to 103.3
mb/d. Brent price averaged $ 78.2 per
barrel amidst volatility. In CY24, Refinery
throughput increased by 600 kb/d to
reach 82.9 mb/d, led by new refineries
capacity additions and stronger non-
OECD throughputs.
In CY24, gasoline demand increased
by only 89 kb/d and diesel growth
deaccelerated by 158 kb/d. Major
demand came from jet fuel, which surged
by 397 kb/d. Key factors to watch in
2025 would be stagnating demand in
China (EV penetration), aviation growth in
Asia, geopolitical uncertainties and new
economic policies (tariffs & sanctions).
With consistent government push
for roads and air connectivity, Indian
Petroleum Product demand rose to an
all-time high of 239 MMTPA at 2.1% Y-o-Y
growth. Climate consciousness has led
to a sustained rise in charging network
presence, (close to 40,000 charging
stations) with a 6 million EV parc. CNGCBG
vehicle parc has also touched
2 million.
